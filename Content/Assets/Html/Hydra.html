            <h1>Bruteforce - Hydra</h1>
            <p>Hydra is a linux tool from the THC group, which enables the attacker to try countless passwords against password protected endpoints. The attacker has to generate or download a password list themself.</p>
            <p>Hydra is a very powerful tool, but it is also very easy to use. The attacker can use the tool to brute force a variety of services, including SSH, FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, Telnet, POP3, IMAP, SMB, VNC, RDP, and many more.</p>

            <h3>Detection</h3>
            <p>When we want to detect a bruteforce attack, we can either look out for the user agent string, which could contain "hydra", or watch out for repeatedly failing login attempts in a short period of time. The time period could also be larger, when the attacker wants to hide the fact that he is attempting a bruteforce attack.</p>
